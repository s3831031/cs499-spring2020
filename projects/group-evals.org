Group evaluations will be used to encourage each group member to
participate equally. Each member of the group will fill an eval form,
in which they will assign a percentage to each group member (including
themself), subject to the constraint that the total percentage must be
100 times the number of group members. Percentages may exceed 100, but
if there are any percentages above 115 or below 85 then they must be
justified with a paragraph in writing. Finally your mean percentage
(as given by yourself and your other group members) will be MULTIPLIED
with your group project score to obtain your final grade for the project.

Example 1: in a group of three, if everyone assigns 100 to everyone
else, then everyone's score is the same as the group score.

Example 2: in a group of two, student A gives 100 to both students,
and student B gives 110 to both students. In that case student B must
re-do the group evaluation, because the total number of points is too
large (the total over students must be 200 but it is 220).

Example 3: in a group of two, student A gives themself 115 and the
other student 85, whereas student B gives 100 to both students. Assume
the group score was 85. Then student A's mean percentage is
(100+115)/2=107.5 and final grade is 107.5*85/100=91.375 (A), whereas
student B's mean percentage is (85+100)/2=92.5 and final grade is
92.5*85/100=78.625 (C).
